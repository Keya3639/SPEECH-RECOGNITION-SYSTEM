# SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM

The **Speech Recognition System** is a Python-based application that automatically converts spoken audio into readable text. Developed using foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) techniques, this tool helps users transcribe voice data with high accuracy. It is designed to simplify tasks that involve capturing and documenting spoken content.

## Overview
This system uses a pre-trained deep learning model based on the Wav2Vec2 architecture for speech-to-text conversion. It works with both recorded .wav files and live microphone input. The model transcribes speech in English and outputs clean, understandable text. Optional enhancements, such as punctuation recovery and language modeling, can further improve its readability and performance.
This project is particularly useful for accessibility solutions, transcription services, developers building voice-enabled applications, and researchers working with audio data.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project, known for its simplicity and robust AI libraries.

- **Transformers (HuggingFace)**: Provides access to pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2 for accurate speech recognition.

- **Torchaudio**: A PyTorch library for audio processing tasks, including loading and transforming audio inputs.

- **SpeechRecognition**: Used for capturing microphone input and acting as a lightweight speech-to-text engine fallback.

- **SoundFile & Librosa**: Handle audio format compatibility, sampling rate conversion, and waveform analysis.

## Why These Tools Were Selected
- **Wav2Vec2** delivers state-of-the-art accuracy without requiring custom training.

- **Transformers** simplifies integration of powerful pre-trained models.

- **Torchaudio** and Librosa allow efficient and flexible audio handling across different formats.

- **Python’s** ecosystem enables rapid development and deployment of AI applications.

## Features
- **Speech-to-text** transcription using pre-trained Wav2Vec2.

- **Support** for microphone input and audio files (WAV).

- **Real-time** or batch transcription capability.

- **Lightweight** command-line interface for quick testing and use.

- **Language** model (optional) for enhanced accuracy and sentence formation.

## Advantages
- **High** accuracy on English audio using cutting-edge deep learning models.

- **Flexible** input options, including microphone or audio files.

- **No** GPU required for basic transcription tasks.

- **Offline-capable** with local model setup.

- **Open-source** and extendable, with support for integration into larger voice-based systems.

## Limitations
- **English-only** support in the current version.

- **No** punctuation or formatting in raw output (unless post-processed).

- **Background** noise can affect transcription quality.

- **Latency** in real-time transcription on low-performance systems.

- **Requires** internet to download models unless cached or stored locally.

## Real-Time Applications
- **Voice Assistants**: Powering conversational interfaces and command interpretation.

- **Lecture and Meeting Transcription**: Document spoken content for review and records.

- **Accessibility Solutions**: Helping individuals with hearing impairments understand spoken information.

- **Customer Service**: Converting call center conversations into text for analysis.

- **Content Creation**: Helping bloggers or YouTubers convert spoken scripts into written content.

- **Interview Documentation**: Simplifying journalist or research work.

## Future Enhancements
- **Add** punctuation restoration for cleaner and more readable output.

- **Multilingual** support for broader applicability.

- **Speaker** diarization to distinguish between multiple speakers in a conversation.

- **File** input from MP3, MP4, or streaming sources.

- **GUI/Web** version for accessibility by non-programmers.

- **API-based** deployment for integration into third-party apps or platforms.

## Conclusion
The Speech Recognition System provides a reliable and accurate method of converting spoken words into text using modern NLP and deep learning methods. With real-world applications across education, business, and accessibility, this project offers a strong foundation for further development into a production-grade ASR system or voice assistant tool.
